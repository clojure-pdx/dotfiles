# Dots

This is a repo to help others bootstrap a development environment for Clojure development.

## Structure

Let's divide up the top level by editor/tool, and have subfolders under there that cover specific subjects.

## How to contribute

Fork this repo, create or use the subdirectory for your editor or tool and write up a nice README.md along with the
configuration file you wish to share.

Submit a PR with your changes and we'll review and get it merged.
