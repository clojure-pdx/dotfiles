* Basic package management in emacs.

This is a short guide on how to get set up with a package manager in emacs.

** MELPA

[[http://melpa.milkbox.net/#/][MELPA]] stands for MELPA (Milkypostmanâ€™s Emacs Lisp Package Archive).

It boasts the following:

- Up-to-date packages built on our servers from upstream source
- Installable in any recent Emacs using "package.el" - no need to install svn/cvs/hg/bzr/git/darcs etc.
- Curated - no obsolete, renamed, forked or randomly hacked packages
- Comprehensive - more packages than any other archive
- Automatic updates - new commits result in new packages
- Extensible - contribute recipes via github, and we'll build the packages

** The trouble with MELPA

=Automatic updates - new commits result in new packages=

This means, pushing to master on GitHub results in a new version of the package. Not every
package maintainer is careful about pushing to master with experimental changes.

Once you install some packages using MELPA, they should be available in =~/.emacs.d/elpa=. I
strongly recommend putting both your =init.el= and the contents of =~/.emacs.d/elpa= into 
version control!

** Installing packages with MELPA

Once you've loaded the configuration in =init.el=, use =M-x package-list-packages= to 
see a list of available packages.

Mark package(s) to be installed by pressing =i=, delete with =d=, and press =x= to perform all the pending operations.
